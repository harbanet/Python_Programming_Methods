    "### Class  and Object\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure). Classes - user defined data types. Objects are instances (instatiation) of the class, with a characteristic of attributes(data, variables) and oerations of methods (functionality). \n",

    "In Python, everything is an object. We use a special method __init__() to create objects from Python classes (used to initialize the attributes of an object)."
